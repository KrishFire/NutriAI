# SubscriptionScreen Fix Summary

## Root Cause
The component was remounting when switching between Monthly and Yearly plans due to a dynamic `key={selectedPlan}` on the animated component.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Dynamic Keys
- **Before**: AnimatePresence with `key={selectedPlan}` on MotiView
- **After**: Static MotiView without any dynamic keys
- **Result**: No more remounting when switching plans

### 2. Fixed React Hooks Order
- **Issue**: Hooks were being called conditionally after early return
- **Fix**: Moved all hooks (useState, useCallback, useMemo) before the early return
- **Added**: Default values for context properties to prevent hook dependency issues

### 3. Proper Null Safety
- **Context Check**: Early return if `useOnboarding()` returns null
- **Callback Protection**: All callbacks check for context availability
- **Default Values**: Provide safe defaults for destructured context values

## Code Changes

```typescript
// Before - Problematic
<AnimatePresence exitBeforeEnter>
  <MotiView key={selectedPlan}>  // ❌ Dynamic key causes remount
    {planContent}
  </MotiView>
</AnimatePresence>

// After - Fixed
<MotiView
  animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
  transition={{ type: 'timing', duration: 200 }}
  style={{ marginBottom: 32 }}
>
  {planContent}  // ✅ No key, no remount
</MotiView>
```

## Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to the Subscription screen in the onboarding flow
2. Toggle between Monthly and Yearly plans
3. Verify:
   - No screen flicker or flash
   - Smooth transitions between plans
   - All buttons work correctly (back, continue, skip)
   - No console errors

## Implementation Notes

- The `planContent` is properly memoized based on `selectedPlan` and `hasReferralCode`
- All animations work through state changes, not component remounting
- The component handles navigation transitions gracefully with null checks
- ESLint warnings about dependency optimization remain but don't affect functionality

## Result

✅ Component no longer remounts when switching plans
✅ Smooth user experience maintained
✅ All React hooks rules followed
✅ Proper null safety implemented
