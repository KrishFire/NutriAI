# Comprehensive Onboarding Flow Design Prompt for NutriAI

## Overview

Design a world-class onboarding experience for NutriAI that converts first-time users into engaged, active users. The onboarding should feel effortless, delightful, and personalized while gathering essential information for AI-powered nutrition tracking. Every screen should maintain the ultra-clean aesthetic inspired by Uber, Robinhood, and Apple's best practices.

## Design Principles for Onboarding

### Core Philosophy

- **Value-First**: Show benefits before asking for information
- **Personalization**: Make users feel the app is tailored for them
- **Frictionless**: Minimize taps and typing
- **Delightful**: Use subtle animations and encouraging copy
- **Trust Building**: Professional design that handles data respectfully

### Visual Consistency

- **Primary Color**: RGB(50, 13, 255) / #320DFF for CTAs and accents
- **Typography**: Inter font throughout
- **Spacing**: 4px grid system
- **Animations**: Smooth, purposeful, 60fps
- **Illustrations**: Modern, minimal, on-brand

### Examples

Instead of: "Enter your biological information"
Use: "Let's get to know you"

Instead of: "Authentication failed"
Use: "That didn't work. Let's try again"

Instead of: "Configure notification preferences"
Use: "When should we remind you to log meals?"

## Platform Considerations

- Safe areas: Respect notch/dynamic island

### Android Specific

3. **Field Accuracy**: Minimal corrections needed
4. **Social Auth**: >60% use social sign in

## Final Implementation Notes

1. **A/B Testing Ready**: Design variants for:

   - Number of value prop screens
   - Permission request timing
   - Progress indicator styles

2. **Personalization Hooks**: Design systems for:
   - Gender-neutral options

The onboarding experience sets the tone for the entire app relationship. Every interaction should feel purposeful, every screen should build trust, and the overall flow should leave users excited to start their nutrition journey with NutriAI.

Remember: Users don't care about creating an account‚Äîthey care about achieving their health goals. The onboarding should feel like the first step toward those goals, not a barrier to using the app.
