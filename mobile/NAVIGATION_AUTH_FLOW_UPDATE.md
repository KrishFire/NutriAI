# Navigation & Auth Flow Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated RootNavigator.tsx
- Added auth state checking to determine which screens to show
- Shows loading spinner while checking auth state
- Navigation flow now follows this logic:
  - If user is NOT authenticated → Show Onboarding + AuthStack
  - If user IS authenticated but hasn't completed onboarding → Show Onboarding
  - If user IS authenticated AND has completed onboarding → Show Main App (with Home screen)

### 2. Added PaywallModal Support
- Added PaywallModal to navigation types in `types/navigation.ts`
- Added PaywallModal screen to the modal group in RootNavigator
- Import PaywallScreen from `screens/premium/PaywallScreen.tsx`

### 3. Added SubscriptionProvider
- Wrapped the app with SubscriptionProvider in App.tsx
- This enables the subscription context throughout the app

## How It Works Now

1. **Login Flow**:
   - User logs in via LoginScreen (email/password or social)
   - AuthContext handles the authentication
   - Navigation automatically switches to Main app (Home screen)

2. **Onboarding Flow**:
   - New user completes onboarding
   - On "Get Started" button in OnboardingCompleteScreen
   - `completeOnboarding()` sets `has_completed_onboarding: true`
   - Navigation automatically switches to Main app (Home screen)

3. **Social Sign-in**:
   - Google/Apple sign-in buttons in LoginScreen
   - After successful auth, user goes directly to Home screen
   - If new user, they see onboarding first

## Testing

To test the navigation flow:

1. **New User Journey**:
   - Start app → See Welcome/Onboarding
   - Complete onboarding → See Home screen

2. **Existing User Journey**:
   - Start app → If logged in → See Home screen
   - If logged out → See Welcome → Login → Home screen

3. **Sign Up from Login**:
   - Login screen → "Sign Up" → Goes to carousel onboarding

The Home screen is now properly connected to the authentication and onboarding flows!
