# Database Fix Summary

## Bug Report
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Fixed

### Root Cause
The `has_completed_onboarding` column was missing from the `user_preferences` table in the production database. The application code expected this column to exist, causing database errors when trying to read or write user preferences.

### Patch Summary
â€¢ File(s) modified: Database schema (via migration)
â€¢ Key change: Added missing `has_completed_onboarding` column to `user_preferences` table

### Database Changes Applied
```sql
-- Add has_completed_onboarding column to user_preferences table
ALTER TABLE user_preferences 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS has_completed_onboarding BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;

-- Update existing users to have completed onboarding
UPDATE user_preferences 
SET has_completed_onboarding = true 
WHERE created_at < NOW();
```

### Validation
â€¢ Column added successfully: `has_completed_onboarding BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false`
â€¢ Existing user preferences updated: 2 records marked as completed onboarding
â€¢ RLS policies verified: Users can read/write their own preferences including the new column
â€¢ Performance: No impact - simple column addition with default value

### Follow-Ups
1. Monitor for any remaining authentication or onboarding issues
2. Consider adding database schema validation to CI/CD pipeline to catch missing columns earlier
3. Ensure all developers have access to run migrations when needed

## Resolution Details

The issue was resolved by:
1. Identifying that the `has_completed_onboarding` column was missing from the production database
2. Applying the existing migration file that adds this column
3. Verifying the column was added with the correct data type and default value
4. Confirming existing RLS policies allow users to access this column
5. Validating that existing user preferences were properly updated

Users should now be able to:
- Successfully log in without database errors
- Complete the onboarding flow
- Have their onboarding status properly tracked
- Navigate to the HomeScreen after authentication
