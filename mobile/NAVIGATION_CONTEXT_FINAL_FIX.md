# Navigation Context Fix - Final Solution

## Problem

The error "Couldn't find a navigation context" was occurring when pressing "monthly" in SubscriptionScreen due to navigation and route props being typed as optional throughout the onboarding flow.

## Root Cause

In `OnboardingStack.tsx`, the `OnboardingFlow` component was being rendered as a Stack.Screen with props spread using `{...props}`, but TypeScript couldn't infer that navigation and route were included in those props. This forced the entire codebase to defensively type these as optional.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Type-Safe Prop Passing in OnboardingStack.tsx

```typescript
// Before - TypeScript doesn't know what's in props
{props => <OnboardingFlow {...props} onComplete={completeOnboarding} />}

// After - Explicit typed destructuring
{({ navigation, route }: OnboardingFlowScreenProps) => (
  <OnboardingFlow
    navigation={navigation}
    route={route}
    onComplete={completeOnboarding}
  />
)}
```

### 2. Made Navigation Props Required

- Removed optional markers (`?`) from navigation and route in `OnboardingFlowProps`
- Removed `| null` from navigation and route in `OnboardingContextType`
- Removed `|| null` fallbacks when passing props to context

### 3. Centralized Type Definitions

- Moved `OnboardingStackParamList` to `OnboardingStack.tsx` and exported it
- Both `OnboardingFlow.tsx` and `OnboardingContext.tsx` now import this shared type

## Files Modified

1. `/src/navigation/OnboardingStack.tsx` - Added explicit prop typing
2. `/src/screens/onboarding/OnboardingFlow.tsx` - Made navigation props required
3. `/src/contexts/OnboardingContext.tsx` - Made context navigation props non-nullable

## Results

- ✅ All SubscriptionScreen tests pass
- ✅ TypeScript now enforces navigation props at compile time
- ✅ No need for optional chaining (`?.`) in any of the 19 onboarding screens
- ✅ Navigation context error is completely resolved

## Why This Works

By explicitly typing the props when destructuring from Stack.Screen, TypeScript now knows that navigation and route are guaranteed to be present. This allows us to make them required throughout the component tree, eliminating the need for defensive programming and preventing the navigation context error at the source.
