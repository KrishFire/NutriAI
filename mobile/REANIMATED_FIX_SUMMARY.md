# Reanimated Error Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ProgressRing Component Interface Mismatch
**Problem**: HomeScreen was using `percentage` prop but ProgressRing expected `progress`
**Solution**: Updated ProgressRing to accept `percentage`, `animate`, `duration` props and support children

### 2. AnimatedNumber Worklet Issues
**Problem**: Non-worklet function being called on UI thread causing synchronous call errors
**Solution**: Replaced Reanimated animation with vanilla React state + requestAnimationFrame to avoid worklet issues

### 3. Missing 'worklet' Directives
**Problem**: Animated callbacks in ProgressRing didn't have 'worklet' directive
**Solution**: Added 'worklet' directive to useAnimatedProps and useAnimatedStyle callbacks

## Remaining Issues to Address

### 1. ValueUnpacker File Error
The error "ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/krishtandon/Desktop/NutriAI/mobile/valueUnpacker'" suggests a missing file or module resolution issue.

**Potential Solutions**:
1. Clear Metro cache: `npx expo start --clear`
2. Reset watchman: `watchman watch-del-all`
3. Clean and rebuild: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
4. Check if there's a missing dependency

### 2. Additional Worklet Issues
Other components might still have worklet issues. Check:
- MotiView animations in HomeScreen
- ParticleEffect component (uses Moti)
- Any other components using Reanimated

## Next Steps

1. **Clear all caches**:
   ```bash
   cd mobile
   rm -rf node_modules
   rm -rf .expo
   npm install
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

2. **If issues persist**, consider:
   - Downgrading react-native-reanimated to a stable version
   - Using Animated API instead of Reanimated for problematic animations
   - Checking Expo SDK compatibility

3. **Test thoroughly** after cache clear to ensure animations work properly
