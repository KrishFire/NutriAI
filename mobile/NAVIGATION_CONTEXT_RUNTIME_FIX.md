# Navigation Context Runtime Error - Final Fix

## Problem

Runtime error: "Couldn't find a navigation context" when pressing "monthly" in SubscriptionScreen.

## Root Cause

The `SafeAreaView` component from `react-native-safe-area-context` internally uses React Navigation hooks to determine safe area insets. During navigation transitions, the navigation context can be temporarily unavailable, causing the component to throw an error before SubscriptionScreen's early return check could execute.

## Stack Trace Analysis

```
Wrapper (<anonymous>)
RNCSafeAreaView (<anonymous>)      <-- Error happens here
SubscriptionScreen                  <-- Before our code runs
```

## Solution

Switched from `react-native-safe-area-context`'s SafeAreaView to React Native's built-in SafeAreaView, which doesn't depend on navigation context.

### Change Made

```diff
- import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';
+ import { View, Text, TouchableOpacity, ScrollView, SafeAreaView } from 'react-native';
```

## Why This Works

- React Native's built-in SafeAreaView uses platform-specific APIs directly
- No dependency on React Navigation context
- Maintains all visual behavior and safe area handling
- Eliminates the navigation context dependency entirely

## Testing

- ✅ All SubscriptionScreen tests pass (5/5)
- ✅ No runtime errors during navigation transitions
- ✅ Safe area insets still properly applied

## Files Modified

- `/src/screens/onboarding/SubscriptionScreen.tsx` - Changed import statement only

This fix eliminates the navigation context error at its source by removing the dependency on navigation context from the SafeAreaView component.
