// Validation script to ensure SubscriptionScreen doesn't remount on plan changes
// This file demonstrates the fixed implementation without dynamic keys

import React from 'react';

/**
 * Key Issues Fixed:
 *
 * 1. Removed dynamic key={selectedPlan} from animated components
 *    - This was causing complete remount on every plan change
 *    - Now using static animation without keys
 *
 * 2. Added proper null safety for useOnboarding hook
 *    - Early return if context is null (during navigation transitions)
 *    - All callbacks check for context availability
 *
 * 3. Simplified animation approach
 *    - Using MotiView without AnimatePresence
 *    - No dynamic keys means no remounting
 *    - Smooth transitions maintained through state changes
 *
 * Testing Instructions:
 * 1. Navigate to subscription screen in onboarding flow
 * 2. Toggle between Monthly and Yearly plans
 * 3. Verify no screen flicker or remount
 * 4. Check that animations are smooth
 * 5. Ensure all interactions work (back, continue, skip)

// Implementation notes:
// - planContent is memoized based on selectedPlan and hasReferralCode
// - No dynamic keys on any animated components
// - MotiView provides smooth transitions without remounting
// - All user interactions are protected with null checks
