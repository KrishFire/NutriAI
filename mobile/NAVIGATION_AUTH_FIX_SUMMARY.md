# Navigation & Auth Error Handling Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Added proper error handling for preferences operations in auth.ts**
   - Now properly handles PGRST116 errors (no rows found) separately from other errors
   - Logs errors but doesn't fail the sign-in process if preferences update fails
   - Wrapped preferences operations in try-catch to handle unexpected errors

2. **Fixed navigation context and mode parameter handling**
   - Added `authMode` to OnboardingStackParamList type definition
   - Added `authMode` to OnboardingData interface
   - Set default initial params in OnboardingStack with authMode: 'signup'
   - OnboardingFlow now properly initializes userData with authMode from route params
   - AuthScreen receives the correct mode based on userData.authMode

3. **Improved robustness of auth flow**
   - Sign-in process continues even if preferences operations fail
   - Users can still access the app even if database preferences have issues
   - Proper error logging for debugging without breaking user experience

## Files Modified

1. `/src/services/auth.ts`
   - Enhanced error handling in signIn function
   - Added specific handling for PGRST116 (no rows found) errors
   - Wrapped preferences operations in try-catch blocks

2. `/src/navigation/OnboardingStack.tsx`
   - Added authMode to OnboardingStackParamList type
   - Set default initialParams with authMode: 'signup'

3. `/src/screens/onboarding/OnboardingFlow.tsx`
   - Initialize userData with authMode from route params
   - Pass authMode to AuthScreen component

4. `/src/contexts/OnboardingContext.tsx`
   - Added authMode field to OnboardingData interface

## Tests Added

- Created `/src/__tests__/auth-service.test.ts` to verify error handling
- Tests confirm that sign-in succeeds even when preferences operations fail
- Tests verify proper handling of missing preferences (PGRST116 errors)

## Mocks Created

- `/mobile/__mocks__/expo-auth-session.js`
- `/mobile/__mocks__/expo-web-browser.js`

These mocks ensure auth service tests can run without actual expo dependencies.

## Key Improvements

1. **Resilient Authentication**: Users can sign in even if database preferences have issues
2. **Proper Navigation Flow**: Auth mode is correctly passed through the navigation stack
3. **Better Error Visibility**: Errors are logged for debugging but don't break the user experience
4. **Test Coverage**: Added tests to ensure error handling works as expected

The navigation flow now properly handles both signup and signin modes, and the auth service is more robust against database errors.
