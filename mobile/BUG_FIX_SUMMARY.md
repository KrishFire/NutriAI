# Bug Fix Summary

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Added Error Boundary for Animations
- Created `AnimationErrorBoundary` component to catch and handle animation errors gracefully
- Wrapped HomeScreen content with the error boundary to prevent crashes
- Shows user-friendly error message with retry option

### 2. ✅ Fixed Memory Leak in useDailyProgress Hook
- Added AbortController to cancel ongoing requests when component unmounts
- Fixed infinite loop caused by fetchDailyProgress dependency
- Added proper cleanup in useEffect
- Only update state if request wasn't aborted

### 3. ✅ Fixed Race Condition in Meal Type Handling
- Added `isAddingToLog` state to prevent multiple simultaneous submissions
- Added small delay to ensure state updates are processed
- Reset state after navigation to handle back navigation

### 4. ✅ Updated HomeScreen Design to Match Figma
- Updated all animations to use faster delays (reduced by 50%)
- Optimized transition durations from 500ms to 300ms
- Reduced stagger delays between animated elements

### 5. ✅ Fixed Colors to Match Figma
- Updated macro colors in tokens.json:
  - Carbs: `#FFA726` (from `#FFC078`)
  - Protein: `#42A5F5` (from `#74C0FC`)  
  - Fat: `#66BB6A` (from `#8CE99A`)
- HomeScreen now uses colors from tokens instead of hardcoded values

### 6. ✅ Fixed Typography Sizes
- Added proper font sizes to tokens.json:
  - Headers: `1.275rem` (20.4px)
  - Body: `0.85rem` (13.6px)
  - Captions: `0.6375rem` (10.2px)
- Updated all Text components in HomeScreen to use tokens.fontSize values

### 7. ✅ Implemented Native iOS Tab Bar Pattern
- Added Platform detection and conditional rendering
- Implemented BlurView for iOS to achieve native blur effect
- Android maintains solid background with border
- Added semi-transparent background overlay for iOS

### 8. ✅ Optimized Animations
- Reduced all animation delays by 50-60%
- Changed stagger delays from 100ms to 50ms
- Animations now feel snappier and more responsive
- All animations use native driver where possible (already configured in Moti)

## Files Modified

1. `/src/components/common/AnimationErrorBoundary.tsx` - New file
2. `/src/components/common/index.ts` - Added export
3. `/src/hooks/useDailyProgress.ts` - Fixed memory leak
4. `/src/screens/FoodDetailsScreen.tsx` - Fixed race condition
5. `/src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` - Updated design, colors, typography, animations
6. `/src/navigation/BottomTabNavigator.tsx` - Added native iOS pattern

## Performance Improvements

- Reduced animation delays improve perceived performance
- Memory leak fix prevents unnecessary re-renders and memory usage
- Race condition fix prevents duplicate meal entries
- Error boundary prevents app crashes from animation failures

## Next Steps

- Monitor for any remaining animation performance issues
- Consider implementing skeleton loaders for better perceived performance
- Add analytics to track error boundary triggers
- Test on various devices to ensure animations perform well
